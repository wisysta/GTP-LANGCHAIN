On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, teaspoon by teaspoon, until it reaches the desired consistency. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.\\n\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to work with.\\n\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin.\\n\\n7. Set your pasta machine to the widest setting and pass the dough through it. Fold the dough into thirds and pass it through the machine again. Repeat this process a few times until the dough becomes smooth and pliable.\\n\\n8. Gradually decrease the width setting on your pasta machine and pass the dough through each setting, folding and rolling it again each time. Continue this process until you reach your desired thickness. For spaghetti or fettuccine, you'll want to stop at a thin setting.\\n\\n9. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For spaghetti or fettuccine, you can use the cutting attachment on your pasta machine or a sharp knife to slice the dough into thin strips. Alternatively, you can use a pasta roller to roll the dough into sheets and then cut it into your desired shape.\\n\\n10. After cutting the pasta, you can cook it immediately in a large pot of boiling salted water for about 2-3 minutes or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta.\\n\\n11. Once cooked, drain the pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce, such as marinara, Alfredo, or pesto.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\",\n",
